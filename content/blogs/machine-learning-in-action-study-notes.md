In recent 3 months, I have spent most of my casual time in studying machine learning algorithms. I'm really a new comer to machine learning. And left college for more than 15 years, no surprise, I have successfully forgotten most of my maths knowledge for such as calculus, linear algebra, probabilities, statistics, etc.

How I began my learning was from reviewing all the maths by reading books, doing exercises, then watching online machine learning videos, and finally following books & tutorials in action.

Next step I plan to work on some real practice projects. But before that, I collected my study notes of machine learning in action in a github repo.

Again, I'm still a freshman in machine learning, so I cannot 100% guarantee that all my understanding in the notes is correct though I have tried my best and hope it is. So if you find anything wrong in the repo, or if you have any comments or suggestions, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Here is the link to my github repo:
